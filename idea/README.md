# Implementation Idea Keyboard and Mouse


Mouse was easy to figure out but i still have to think about keyboard. I want everything to work with just a camara of a Laptop 
## Mouse
**Function**
With the Laptop camera or an external camera. it detects the movment of a hand and turn it into mouse movement

**Function Wish list**
- create a square with gesture to make mouse square to help adjest sensitivity

## Keyboard
**Function**
With the Laptop camera or an external camera. detects contact between two fingers.

an example would be touch your pinky with thumb once is for 1 

for every touch it changes layer, so touch once it gives 1, touch twice q
